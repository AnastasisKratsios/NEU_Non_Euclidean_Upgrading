## What does the code do?

NEU is a meta-procedure which generically learns a robust feature map which upgrades the performance of standard learning algorithms.  

### In this repo you'll find:
- An implementation of NEU-OLS, NEU-PCA, and NEU Gradient boosted random forest,
- An implementation of NEU-PCA and NEU-Auto-Encoder

- A data simulator to test NEU and its benchmarked methods against.
